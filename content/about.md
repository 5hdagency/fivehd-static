# About
When you meet the 5HD team, you’ll feel like you’ve known us forever.
Usually that’s a good thing. We’re a team of writers, designers, developers, and strategists who invest ourselves completely in your goals and challenges. We measure ourselves by your success (and we think we’re kind of awesome), so you can feel confident that we will sweat the details from start to finish.

5HD was born as 5 Horizons Digital, joining Triad Advertising and Red Ball Promotions as a part of the Triad Advertising Companies. Like any self-respecting younger sibling we quickly strove for independence – grabbing a shorter handle (5HD) and establishing our identity as one of New England’s leading digital agencies (happily backed by Triad’s 20-year tradition of excellence).

As part of an established advertising family, we offer our clients access to integrated solutions with the resources and talents of a full-service ad agency, as well as a promotional products division with creative gifts, apparel and premium items.

Above all else, we believe in partnership. That’s why we keep things simple – no retainers, no surprises, no divas. Just you, us, and your goals.

Give us a call – we can’t wait to get started.
